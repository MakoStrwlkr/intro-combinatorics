# Introduction to combinatorics
This is a repository I made for posterity in summer 2022 as I was learning combinatorics myself.

Currently, it doesn't contain anything substantial but here are the topics that I would like to write about (hopefully) over the next few months (May to August 2022).

## Strings, sets, binomial functions
Introduction to basic counting techniques, combinations, permutations, orderings, and counting principles. Emphasis on interpretation over strings and sets. Elementary number theory results. Binomial coefficients.

## Induction
Recurrences and induction. Lattice paths. Catalan numbers. Binomial theorem.

## TBD...
